## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version control is a system that tracks changes to code, documents, or other digital content over time. It helps developers collaborate on projects by managing different versions of their work. Here are the fundamental concepts:

1. Repository (Repo): The central location where all versions of the code are stored.
2. Commit: A snapshot of changes made to the code, saved in the repository.
3. Branch: A separate line of development in the repository, allowing multiple versions to coexist.
4. Merge: Combining changes from two branches into a single branch.

GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code because it:

1. Hosts repositories: Provides a cloud-based location for storing and managing code.
2. Facilitates collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously.
3. Tracks changes: Displays a record of all commits, making it easy to identify who made changes and when.
4. Supports branching and merging: Allows developers to experiment with new features without affecting the main codebase.
## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?Setting up a new repository on GitHub involves the following key steps:

1. Create a new repository:
    - Log in to your GitHub account.
